# Intro section with dropdown navigation

The **Navigation Dropdown App** showcases a modern UI design with an introductory section featuring a dropdown navigation. The project, inspired by a challenge from [FrontendMentors](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5), is responsive across various screen sizes. Leveraging Flexbox and media queries, the design ensures an optimal user experience. Noteworthy features include webkit animations during site loading and the implementation of React Portals to replicate a sidebar modal on mobile or tablet views. Additionally, the navigation hover modal functionality is achieved through JavaScript

## Overview

### The challenge

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

1. **Image Handling:** Addressing challenges associated with the integration of distinct images for desktop and mobile views.
2. **React Portal:** Overcoming obstacles and learning the nuances of using React Portals to define a modal component within the parent app component.
3. **Responsive Design:** Ensuring responsiveness across diverse devices and screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries.

## My process

### Built with

The project is built using the following technologies, frameworks, and libraries:

- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project provided valuable learning experiences:
- Mastery of React Portals and their application for creating responsive sidebar modals.
- Enhanced proficiency in responsive design through Flexbox and media queries.
- Practical implementation of webkit animations for a more engaging user interface..

### Continued development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
